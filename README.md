# Automated-Event-Classification
The files available in this repository were used to obtain the results presented in the paper "Automated Event Classification in Power PlantsBased on DFR Data and Symmetrical Components". The Matlab and Simulink files generate the dataset. The JupiterNotebook are used: 1) to convert .mat files to .npy files; 2) to training and validation of the CNN; 3) to validation of the CNN; 4) to the fuzzy classification.
